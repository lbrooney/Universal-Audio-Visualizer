I tested the functionality of the slider, menu, and how the data is processed. For the slider I gave the user interface all the combination of 
different inputs to see if it was able to change to each selection flawlessly and without creating errors. For the top menu I also had to
manually test the functionality and if any new tabs crashed as a result of the user. Initially I also created the test to output to a wav file
to confirm functionality of the older recording system. This worked and accurately recorded the audio. However, as we would later find out wouldn't
be efficient enough to be used by the application.
For both the menu and slider, any new functionality was also left to run over an extended period of time to see if new bugs or crashes occured. 
Lastly, for the processing of the data it was manually tested through
semaphores and print statements to see if it could keep up with the audio being recorded.
