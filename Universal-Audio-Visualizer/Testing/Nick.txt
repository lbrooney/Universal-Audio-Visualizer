To test the buttons in the user interace, I printed out the result of the processed data and compared it with what was being 
displayed. Functionality of the buttons was checked manually by clicking all the possible combinations of existing buttons and
newly added features to ensure that the code doesn't conflict with existing functionality.
To check the color module that picks up the tempo, I played varying types of music and checked if the color changing
is capable of picking up on the tempo. This was then run for an extended periods of time to make sure it didn't enduce new
system crashes or interferes with existing code.
