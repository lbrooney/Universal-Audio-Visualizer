I tested the visualizer module to ensure that the images being produced are accurate with the frequency being picked up from the audio recorder.
Testing of the OpenGl module and the displaying of shapes were manually performed and verified through a visual inspection. First I tested the shape
generation to check that shapes are created and tranformed correctly. I manually created each type of shape and then tested the translation, scale,
and rotation functions to ensure that object transformations worked as expected. After those were verified to be working, I was able to use the
rotation function to spin the shapes around and make sure that the shapes were generated and shaded correctly. After, I ensured that the shapes
matched the audio frequencies. To do this I used an online tone generator and compared the frequency waves displayed on our application with the
online generator. To test the beat and tempo detection, I printed the tempo currently being sent to the visualizer and compared it to the tempo
of the song which was found online.
