I tested the visualizer module to ensure that the images being produced are accurate with the frequency being picked up from the audio recorder.
Manual testing of the OpenGl module and the displaying of shapes had to be manually confirmed and couldn't be automated. I ensured that the shapes
matched the audio as well as the frequency. To do this I used an online frequency generator and compared if the frequency waves displayed on our
application alligned with the online generator. I also printed the frequency, beat, and tempo currently being sent to the visualizer
to compare the accuracy of the waves being generated as well as how precise the rythm of the music was being displayed.
