To test the manual color module, I went through all the possible combination of color switches, switching back and forth as well as 
pressing other menu functionality to check for any crashes that may occur in the system. To test the closing, restart, and menu modules,
after implmenetation I checked for functionality and exit error code to check for any errors and possible memory leaks that
may not have been properly freed.
